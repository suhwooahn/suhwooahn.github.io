Suhwoo Ahn is a PhD candidate on the academic job market in the Department of Communication at Michigan State University. Suhwoo is advised by Dr. Dustin Carnahan.

Suhwoo's research centers on how communication processes shape attitudes and beliefs about the political world, for better or for worse. This connects his work on political media use to misinformation. Specifically, he is interested in a) the mechanisms underlying selection behavior and cognitive processing of pro- and counter-attitudinal news, b) the influence of political news consumption on animosity toward and beliefs in misinformation about opposing party members, and c) the effectiveness of communication strategies aimed at mitigating negative affect toward those with opposite viewpoints. He is also interested in applying computational methods in examining communication phenomena.

His work has led to scholarly publications in leading journals in the field, such as *Journal of Communication*, *Communication Monographs*, and *Patient Education and Counseling*. He employs various methods, including surveys, online experiments, natural language processing, and machine learning. He received a cloud computing fellowship at Michigan State University.
