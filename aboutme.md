Suhwoo Ahn is an assistant professor in the School of Media and Advertising at Kookmin University in Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Suhwoo's research centers on how the media shapes attitudes and beliefs about the political world. This connects his work on political media use to beliefs in misinformation. Specifically, he studies peopleâ€™s susceptibility to political misinformation, strategies for correcting misinformed beliefs, and the role of the media in reinforcing or mitigating biased perceptions of politics. Building on this work, he examines the adoption of AI technologies in the media and their impact on political biases.

Suhwoo was a postdoctoral researcher in the Minnesota Journalism Center at the Hubbard School of Journalism & Mass Communication, University of Minnesota. He completed his PhD in Communication at Michigan State University. His work has led to scholarly publications in leading journals in the field, such as *Journal of Communication*, *Human Communication Research*, and *Commmunication Monographs*. He employs various methods, including surveys, online experiments, natural language processing, and machine learning.
